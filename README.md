# link-preview-server

This is a simple NodeJS wrapper around the npm library [link-preview-generator](https://github.com/AndrejGajdos/link-preview-generator) created by [AndrejGajdos](https://github.com/AndrejGajdos) - you can read more about how the library works on [Andrej's blog](https://andrejgajdos.com/how-to-create-a-link-preview/).

The server accepts a url and returns preview data (a title, description, image, domain name).
